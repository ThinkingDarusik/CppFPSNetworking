# CppFPSNetworking
Basic Networking Example using UE5 CPP

Since I've been copyright claimed before for uploading an Unreal project on a public repository, I'll upload only the neccessary files. So If you just try to build this project, it might not work as is.

## How to build

### Method 1 (Recommended, a bit more complicated):
1. Clone into the repository and download all the files.
1. Create your CPP first person project in Unreal Engine 5
1. Delete all the cpp code in the default character and the weapon component
1. Copy and paste the code in this repo, and fix the red squigglies as needed (probably folder structure), *mind the class and project name*.
1. *double check the class and project name*
1. Compile and fix red squigglies as needed

### Method 2 (Not recommended, much simpler):
1. Clone into the repository
1. Try building the project
