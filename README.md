1. Create your CPP first person project in Unreal Engine 5
1. Delete all the cpp code in the default character and the weapon component
1. Copy and paste the code in this repo, and fix the red squigglies as needed (probably folder structure), *mind the class and project name*.
1. *double check the class and project name*
1. Compile and fix red squigglies as needed

### Method 2 (Not recommended, much simpler):
